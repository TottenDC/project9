# TechDegree Unit 9 Project - Create a Gallery App with React

## Purpose:
* Practice basic React concepts: components, state, props, and lifecycle hooks.
* Work with integrating API JSON response and data presentation on a dynamic site.
* Practice building a Single Page Application using [React Router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router).
## Note:
* Initial CSS and HTML mockups provided by Treehouse.
* I completely built the React app and updated the CSS to reflect personal style. 
## To Use:
Use `npm install` to download all dependencies.
**Note:** You will need your own config.js with an API key from flickr. See [here](https://www.flickr.com/services/api/).

Once installed, run `npm start` to start a development server.

Enjoy!
